## About the Project
As part of a university project, we were tasked with creating a 2D game for our Visual Computing (VJ) course. We chose to develop a small, playable demo inspired by the classic game [Super Mario Bros](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros). Our aim was to replicate the essence, look, and feel of this iconic platformer, using the original physics and game logic that made it a legend. The development of this project took place between September and November 2023.
